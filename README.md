# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Walktrhought

- It took me a day and some change to figure out a proper solution. I realized that the fetch calls should only be done once, so the data would be only fetched once and saved on the app

- At first i didint full comprehend the instructions properly so i build an app which only displayed data from **GET /products/:category** endpoint, then i realized i had to also had to use the **/availability/:manufacturer** endpoint. 

- At first i wanted to the user to decide when to fetch data from **/availability/:manufacturer** endpoint. But realized that the less options the user has the better.
