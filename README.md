# Reaktor task

The idea was to create an UI that a company could use to easily keep track of their online inventory. The catch was using two "legacy APIs" to fetch data

## Bugs

I noticed that there is a bug : If user checks availablity from the same manufacturer quickly it does two identical fetch calls. This doesnt really matter becouse once all manufacturer data is fetched, duplicates dont matter.
